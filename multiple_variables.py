# demo using multiple variables

# create two variables
top_speed=200
distance=300

# display variables in output
print("The top speed was", top_speed, "mph", "and distance was", distance, "miles")

# create variable for time traveled
time_of_travel=distance/top_speed

# display time of travel
print("The time of travel was",time_of_travel , "hours")
